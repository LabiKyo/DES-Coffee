## What's This?

Just as the name implies, this is a DES CoffeeScript Implementation. It is a homework assignment of BUAA Software Engineering's information security course. [**Wang Haiquan**](mailto:whq@buaa.edu.cn) is the lecturer of this course. And [**Yu Yang**](mailto:whqkiko441500@163.com) is the TA.

I'm asked to implement DES using C or Java, but I haven't been coding C/Java for a long time, and more familiar with scripting languages like Python, CoffeeScript/JavaScript, Ruby. So I decided to [implement DES in Ruby first](https://github.com/LabiKyo/DES-Ruby) as a good starting point, then rewrite it using C or Java. But later on I found it's hard for TA to run my Ruby script, and I don't have too much time. So I decided to write a CoffeeScript Implement.

## Why You Create This Repository?

I know there are thousands of implementation for DES and mine might be the worst, I just do it in order to prove that I implement this algorithm myself. It's also a practice for BDD, sharing and open-source coding. Also, I want to have some code to show my future employe{r,e} and friends.
